WebTrader
=========
A simple trading web application for buying and selling stock, among other trading operations, with real market data, built using the Flask web framework, Jinja2 template engine, Bootstrap front-end framework, and Markit Data API.

Porting my command-line trading application TerminalTrader (https://github.com/matthewmuccio/TerminalTrader) to a large-scale Flask web application with a front-end interface and a SQLite database back-end.
