# FlaskEcommerceWebApp
A simple e-commerce web app built with the Flask web microframework and Bootstrap framework for the front-end.
Porting my command-line application TerminalTrader (https://github.com/matthewmuccio/TerminalTrader) to a large-scale Flask web application with a front-end interface.

Process
=======
I plan to keep the MVC design pattern intact, and preserve the core business logic (Python code) in the model.
I will replace the controller with the Flask web microframework.
And I will replace the view with a front-end interface written in HTML, CSS, & JS, which resides in the templates directory.
